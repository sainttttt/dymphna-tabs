# dymphna tabs

Chrome MV3 extension which automatically saves all tabs every n-minutes. Prevents ever losing your state if your browser crashes or a reboot etc. Can also manually trigger a save. Saving tabs don't close them unlike most tab savers.


Also have some other tab QoL features, such as opening a new tab next to the parent tab, but a brand new tab by Cmd/Ctrl-T opens at the end (or beginning).
